# Employee Performance Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts employee performance (Low, Average, High) using a Random Forest Classifier.  
The model is trained on synthetic employee data, including age, experience, education level, working hours, and projects completed.

## Features
- Data preprocessing (encoding education & performance levels)
- Random Forest Classifier for prediction
- Accuracy optimization (up to ~80%)
- New employee performance prediction

## Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn
